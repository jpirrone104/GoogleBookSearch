# GoogleBookSearch

Google book search is a reach MERN app. This app uses the google books API to return results, and allows you to save a book for later, or visit the link to purchase it. 

Current Defects - 

**The 'delete' button sometimes takes two clicks to work <br>
**The 'save for later' button is currently showing on the saved list - and clicking it will save the book twice to your database. 

To run this application locally, git clone this repository and then use NPM install to install all necessary packages in both the client and root directories.
